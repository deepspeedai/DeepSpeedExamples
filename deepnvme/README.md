This folder contains performance micro-benchmarks of using DeepNVMe for various I/O data transfer scenarios. `GDS` mode transfers is supported on compatible platforms

ds_io: Sweep scripts for the `ds_io` I/O performance utility. `ds_io` is a `fio`-like utility for measuring read and write performance of raw I/O transfers involving CPU or GPU buffers. 

file_access: Scripts for measuring file acesses involving CPU or GPU buffers. 

zero_inference: Weight-offloading for LLM inference.
